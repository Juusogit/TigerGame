"Camoon tiikeri, näytä muna!", (C'moon tiger, show dick! eng.) is a positive encouragement shouted by a random 
man from Finland to one of the best USA's professional golf-player of all time, Eldrick Tont ”Tiger” Woods, 
while he was casually walking at the golf-game. The anonymous man recorded while he was shouting with a phone. 
The video was uploaded to YouTube on 20th of July in 2019. The video got 361 thousand views in less than two 
years and the video had over six thousand likes in 22 of June in 2021. The video immediately got a massive 
fan base and it started a new way to say "Yeah, you can do it!" in Finland. The video was later uploaded to 
TikTok and got a massive viewer base there as well. For example, in Finnish TikTok, there's a sound circling 
around which includes the famous quote "Camoon tiikeri, näytä muna!" and then followed by a song from Golf 
Daddy Official Visualizer (feat. Hessu & Korhone). The quote has also been remixed and made into a viral video
and song on YouTube in 15th of November in 2019. "Camoon tiikeri näytä muna REMIX" has 179 thousand views and
over 2800 likes on 22 of June in 2021.

Idea peliin ja sen toteuttamiseen tuli alkuperäisestä tiikerivideosta, sekä Sakarin villapaitapelistä.
